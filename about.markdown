## Tragically Me

![Photo of Jeffrey Hulten](/images/headshot.jpg){: .left} There is a geek who lives in the beautiful pacific northwest, in a city called Seattle.  He works as a Systems Engineer at a company called All Star Directories.

This geek (we will call him &#8216;Jeff&#8217;) is a man of many interests.  He is an avid reader appreciating, among other subjects, classic and contemporary science fiction from Isaac Asimov to David Weber.  He is a licensed [amateur radio operator](http://n7yhl.net) and has studied [martial arts](http://www.woodinvillema.com/).  For a couple of years he worked with his county search and rescue as a communications and documentation specialist.  He also enjoys working on his own [software projects](/projects.html) in his spare time.

As a fourth generation native of the Seattle area Jeff grew up not far from where he lives today, outside a small town called Bothell.  He graduated high school and went to the University of Washington for a couple of years before running out of money.  While at the UW he pursued his passion of theater by working towards a degree in Technical Theater.  At the same time he pursued his passion of eating more than just ramen and Taco Bell by working as the computer technician for the UW Sociology Department.  Since then he has continued to pursue cash flow by working for Nortel Networks, Microsoft and Washington Mutual.
