  		<content:encoded><![CDATA[ This weekend I will be participating in the [48 Hour Film Project](http://www.48hourfilm.com/) for the second year.  This year my team is named after the producers company, Ultra Digital Films.  We start at 7PM on Friday and must have a completed four to seven minute film completed by 7:30PM on Sunday.  Then we sleep.

Showings will be this coming Wednesday through Friday and the Harvard Exit in Seattle.
