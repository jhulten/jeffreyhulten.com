  		<content:encoded><![CDATA[ E-mail is a great tool that is being used in the wrong way all over in American businesses today. Have you ever gotten an email from someone in the next cube asking if you want to go to lunch? I have. Have you ever asked someone to go to lunch with you and heard them say “I can’t. I am waiting on an important e-mail.” E-mail is a misused tool and like using a sledgehammer to put a nail in the wall to hang a picture, misused tools result in people getting hurt.<!--more-->

There is a great podcast called Manager Tools where they discuss many issues in the world of being a manager today. The episode (at <http://www.manager-tools.com/2005/09/got-email/>) was very helpful to me.  Even though I am not currently a manager, the topics they discuss have as much relevance to me as an employee and they would to someone who is actively managing people.

The real issue is that people have too many things that want their attention and e-mail is in some ways satisfying. You can reply or delete or file an e-mail and feel like you got something done. It is a false achievement, one that comes at the expense of doing real work.

We as a people need to fundamentally change the way we use e-mail. That includes WHEN we use email and for what kinds of communications. It means not hitting ‘Reply to All’. It means only including the people that need the information you are presenting. It means not checking email every few minutes. Let it go. If it is real important, that is what your cell phone is for.

  		<content:encoded><![CDATA[ Lately I have been thinking a fair bit about my internal practices. Specifically what things I do on a daily, weekly or other regular basis. These things break out into beneficial routines and detrimental routines. Here is a snapshot of what I have captured.

### BENEFICIAL

- Review my todo list first thing when I get into work in the morning.
- Check my work email only a couple of times per day.
- Prioritize my work.
- Update my todo list with everything that I get done or need to do.
- Spend time on professional development.
- Get a few minutes of face time with my boss.

### DETRIMENTAL

- Getting on my computer before work in the morning.
- Check my personal email at work more than once a day.

Then there are things I need to be doing and aren't:

- Purge items from my todo list/replyto mailbox that I have not gotten too and is not important to my goals.
- Breaking tasks into manageable next actions consistently and immediately.

What is your daily routine?

  		<title>Weekly Routine</title>

  		<content:encoded><![CDATA[ You may have seen my [daily routine](/2009/02/24/daily-routine/) a while back. On top of having a daily routine, I find its important to have a weekly routine as well. My weekly routine is for things that I don't want to tackle every day (I am tired when I get home from work and don't want to spend my time paying bills) but need to get done regularly.

Therefore I have been building a weekly routine. The problem with a weekly routine is that it is harder to internalize than a daily routine.

So far I have managed a little bit of weekly routine at work on Mondays:
<ul>
	<li>review open tickets and determine priority for tasks this week</li>
	<li>review open tasks for items that haven't been touched in a couple of weeks
<ul>
	<li>consider removing those items entirely or moving to a someday file</li>
	<li>if they need to stay, consider their priority or if they can be delegated</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>review schedule and meetings this week
<ul>
	<li>block out large chunks of time for tasks</li>
	<li>leave the small gaps (for me, one hour or less) for other people to schedule meetings in</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
Here are the things I am trying to make a weekly routine:
<ul>
	<li>process postal mail (bills, etc.)</li>
	<li>do financial stuff (check accounts, verify payments, etc.)</li>
</ul>

  		<content:encoded><![CDATA[ Ah, the final day of No Fluff...

I spent the morning talking with Barbee Davis and Suzie Lewis Ship about topics ranging from science fiction to Agile development. As a result I missed Ken Sipe's Iteration 0 panel.

### 7 Habits of Highly Effective Developers - Ken Sipe

Ken's session is about applying the [The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0743269519?ie=UTF8&tag=tragicallyl33-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0743269519) by Stephen Covey to software developers. 

Covey's seven habits are:
- be proactive
- begin with the end in mind
- put first things first
- seek first to understand, then to be understood
- synergize
- sharpen the saw

Ken referred to a blog post "[Top 5 Attributes of Highly Effective Programmers](http://www.philosophicalgeek.com/2008/01/20/5-attributes-of-highly-effective-programmers/)". The attributes from that post are:

- Humility
- Love of Learning
- Detail Orientedness
- Adaptability
- Passion

He has his own list: 

- focused on a mission with a vision
- best researcher
- best debugger
- god complex when it comes to software development
  - not a lack of humility
  - just optimism to be able to do anything on the computer
- quality focused
- detailed oriented!

### Clojure - Howard Lewis Ship

I have never programmed in Lisp. Considering the other panels in the same time slot I figured I would do something about that and increase my knowledge with the Clojure session.

Clojure is a partial Lisp clone on the JVM with support for software transactional memory to keep your concurrent processes running smoothly.

### Hacking Your Brain for Fun and Profit - Nathaniel Schutta

This was the last panel I attended for the weekend, and a lot of fun. I enjoy thinking about and discussing learning techniques and such.

The only topic I will touch on here is the need for sleep. According to the [research](http://www.spokane.wsu.edu/ResearchOutreach/Sleep/documents/2003SLP-VanDongen-etal.pdf) Nate referenced, if you consistently get six hours of sleep when you need eight it is like missing two nights of sleep. Staying up one night results in a 30% drop in cognitive function...

So go take a nap. A 26 minute nap gives a 34% boost to performance.
