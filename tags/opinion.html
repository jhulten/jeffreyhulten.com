  		<content:encoded><![CDATA[ Plagiarism has become significantly easier to both commit and, to an extent, detect with the advent of the Internet.  It is not acceptable at any level of education to commit plagiarism but it is also important to TEACH what plagiarism is, why it is bad and how to avoid it, including the rules of fair use and proper citation.  I think that plagiarism prevention should be taught starting with the first research or non-fiction, non-autobiographical paper a student is assigned.  Once plagiarism is defined, the penalties can be laid out as well.  Caught plagiarizing?  Fail the assignment.  Sometimes kids (myself included way in the back when) need to fail to get the message.

More than just plagiarism is at stake.  This mentality, both on the part of the students that were failed and the parents that got it overturned is the basis for much of this countries woes with other copyright and intellectual property enforcement.  Children are not taught that just because it is easy and there isn't a physical item involved (like shoplifting a CD) does not mean that it is stealing and against the law.

Some people will lie and cheat to get what they want, regardless of age (Kenneth Lay, anyone?).  It is important that students learn that there are real consequences for such actions before those consequences are irrevocable.

  		<content:encoded><![CDATA[ Thinking of technology and the World Cup, here is another opinionated segment.

I think the concept of absolute fairness is a black hole; a place where common sense is corrupted into political correctness.  We do not enforce an even playing field today in competitive sports.  For example, some kids have better health care or can afford a better trainer.

The question to my mind regards the impact of these 'smart shoes'.  Is there a significant improvement to a runners ability?  Does it reduce the chance of injury?  In my opinion the point of competition is for human beings to spur themselves to greater heights by comparing their achievements to others.  If this is the point and smart shoes measurably improve runner performance then there is a case for them to be banned, the case that this is a competition of humans, not humans and machines.

It is an interesting problem that we have not dealt with on an emotional and ethical level.  If we make judgment calls about what counts as unfair and what does not, then we risk losing the objectivity that fairness is built on.  If we make blanket statements about not allowing 'enhanced' humans compete, how do we deal with the kid that has the aural implant to allow him to hear or the chip in his brain to control epilepsy.  This kind of conflict of which science fiction blockbusters are made.

  		<content:encoded><![CDATA[ There are valid concerns that the new technologies available are distracting drivers from driving, which is their primary task.  I have used my smart phone on the road, but I am careful to chose the time and place.  My opinion is that we need to enforce the results, not the cause.  As a country we seem to be nit-picking symptoms instead of the cause.  Instead of addressing long commute times and bad traffic conditions by building better roads or increasing public transit we want to ding people that are using their smart phones to find a route around or are talking on their phones to wile away the time.

If the issue is distraction, why are we not talking about outlawing arguing children in the back seat of a car?  As a society, why are we not writing tickets left and right when people rubberneck at the scene of a traffic accident?  Technology requires people to learn the right and wrong way to use it.  We are just now seeing an establishment of manners in regards to use of cellular phones in public places.  You cannot legislate common sense and attempts to do so will just make more people into lawbreakers and lower their interest in playing by the rules.

  		<content:encoded><![CDATA[ Digital data will not last forever unless we decide it is important.  To my mind this is a good thing.  In 200 years I really don't care if an anthropologist can look at my past bank statements.  The other side of the digital data explosion is that most of the data in the world now is CRAP.  I don't want to keep every spam message I have ever received. The important data I will chose to preserve.

I don't think this is particularly different from the written word.  Some people saved everything on paper, but many kept only what was important.  If something is important to me I will have it backed up and it will move forward in technology as I do.

  		<content:encoded><![CDATA[ When I look at questions like this I am reminded of the U.S. Supreme Court case, "Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc." also know and the "Betamax Case".  The decision of the court was that "making of individual copies of complete television shows for purposes of time-shifting does not constitute copyright infringement, but is fair use. The Court also ruled that the manufacturers of home video recording devices, such as Betamax or other VCRs (referred to as VTRs in the case), cannot be liable for infringement."  (Wikipedia)

It established a rule for technology that might be used to infringe copyright law, specifically: "The question is thus whether the Betamax is capable of commercially significant non-infringing uses..." (464 U.S. 417)

I think this is a excellent test for all technology.  If a product is capable of and primarily used for legal purposes then thats all I require.  I am not interested in buying anti-counterfeiting printers or scanners.  I am not going to counterfeit anything, but as the consumer I have to pay a higher price for something I don't want.

This puts government in a bad spot, but penalizing the many for the actions of the few is not acceptable.

  		<content:encoded><![CDATA[ This is a subject near and dear to my heart.  I think that open source is a fabulous thing, but by no means is the only way.  Some people say that having the source code open is an invitation to malicious code, data vandals and viruses.  Those people only need to look at the largest closed operating system in use today (Windows) to see that protecting your secrets is no way to guarantee security.  Just as an open source project has its code open for anyone to look at to find an exploit, it is also open that anyone can find that exploit and report it.  Thankfully there are still more honest people in the world than dishonest people, at least when you are talking about software.

For those that argue that programmers should be able to control and profit from their software you only need to look at Linux Torvalds to see that open source can be a career enhancer.  There is nothing preventing you from controlling or profiting from your code, open source is not mandatory.  You may have to write more of your code from scratch if the libraries you want to reuse that were written by others are licensed to prevent you from using them in a closed manner, but that is just that libraries coder controlling and profiting (in getting to see and use what you do with his/her code as opposed to money) from it.

It is proven that you can profit from an open model.  The SugarCRM customer relationship management software suite is an example of this.  Available for all, but they will host it or customize it or support it for you... for a fee.

Open source allows for far more innovation in a community by establishing defined rules for sharing your work and research.
