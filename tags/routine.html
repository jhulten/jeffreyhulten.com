  		<content:encoded><![CDATA[ Lately I have been thinking a fair bit about my internal practices. Specifically what things I do on a daily, weekly or other regular basis. These things break out into beneficial routines and detrimental routines. Here is a snapshot of what I have captured.

### BENEFICIAL

- Review my todo list first thing when I get into work in the morning.
- Check my work email only a couple of times per day.
- Prioritize my work.
- Update my todo list with everything that I get done or need to do.
- Spend time on professional development.
- Get a few minutes of face time with my boss.

### DETRIMENTAL

- Getting on my computer before work in the morning.
- Check my personal email at work more than once a day.

Then there are things I need to be doing and aren't:

- Purge items from my todo list/replyto mailbox that I have not gotten too and is not important to my goals.
- Breaking tasks into manageable next actions consistently and immediately.

What is your daily routine?

  		<content:encoded><![CDATA[ You may have seen my [daily routine](/2009/02/24/daily-routine/) a while back. On top of having a daily routine, I find its important to have a weekly routine as well. My weekly routine is for things that I don't want to tackle every day (I am tired when I get home from work and don't want to spend my time paying bills) but need to get done regularly.

Therefore I have been building a weekly routine. The problem with a weekly routine is that it is harder to internalize than a daily routine.

So far I have managed a little bit of weekly routine at work on Mondays:
<ul>
	<li>review open tickets and determine priority for tasks this week</li>
	<li>review open tasks for items that haven't been touched in a couple of weeks
<ul>
	<li>consider removing those items entirely or moving to a someday file</li>
	<li>if they need to stay, consider their priority or if they can be delegated</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>review schedule and meetings this week
<ul>
	<li>block out large chunks of time for tasks</li>
	<li>leave the small gaps (for me, one hour or less) for other people to schedule meetings in</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
Here are the things I am trying to make a weekly routine:
<ul>
	<li>process postal mail (bills, etc.)</li>
	<li>do financial stuff (check accounts, verify payments, etc.)</li>
</ul>
