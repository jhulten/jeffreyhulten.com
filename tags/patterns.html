  		<content:encoded><![CDATA[ I am learning about patterns and pattern languages here at [OOPSLA](http://oopsla.org/2006/) and [PLoP](http://hillside.net/plop/2006/) in Portland and I see a misconception in how patterns are used in some parts of industry, in PHP development in particular...

Namely, an implementation of a pattern is not the same as a pattern.

If you implement the patterns from the Gang of Four's [Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ASIN=0201633612&tag=tragicallyl33-20&lcode=xm2&cID=2025&ccmID=165953&location=/o/ASIN/0201633612%3FSubscriptionId=0EMV44A9A5YT1RVDGZ82) in your favorite language that does not make your work a pattern.  A pattern is a thing you build, a process for building it, and a rule of when to build it.  It does not define if you build it in Java, C# or PHP.

This does not reduce the value of the work, but it is confusing to call them patterns. Patterns transcend implementation. If you look to the proverbial godfather of patterns, Christopher Alexander, and his book [A Pattern Language](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ASIN=0195019199&tag=tragicallyl33-20&lcode=xm2&cID=2025&ccmID=165953&location=/o/ASIN/0195019199%3FSubscriptionId=0EMV44A9A5YT1RVDGZ82) you see that in some ways his patterns transcend even the domain (architecture and building design) that they were written for.  These pattern are in some ways generative, creating  or inspiring thought in areas other than in originally intended audience.

Grails is an open-source web framework written in Groovy. Grails is being used by major players like Wired.com, Taco Bell in Canada, and more. 

If you have ever created a domain (model) object in Grails and noticed the scaffolding lists fields in alphabetical order, there is a simple way past this. When you add your fields to the static constraints closure, Grails will output them in the order provided.

{% highlight groovy %}
class MyObject {
	String firstName
	String lastName
	Integer age
	
	static constraints = {
		lastName()
		firstName()
		age()
	}
}
{% endhighlight %}

Want to add Lucene to your application? Try this.

{% highlight text %}
> grails install-plugin searchable
{% endhighlight %}

All that is left to give yourself a search engine is add searchable=true to your domain classes.

{% highlight groovy %}
class MyObject {
	...
	static searchable = true	
	...
}
{% endhighlight %}

Once you have done that, start your application with grails run-app annd go to http://localhost:8080/app/searchable to see your search page.

### Design Patterns in Java and Groovy - Venkat Subramaniam

I have always had an interest in patterns since I attended Pattern Languages of Programming (PLoP) in 2006. Venkat refered to Java as a post-pattern language; the Gang of Four Design Patterns book came out just before Java, and so patterns are far easier to implement in Java than C++. Likewise we have power and flexibility in Groovy that we do not have in Java that enables pattern implementation.

I found myself in an interesting conversation with Barbee Davis and Ted Neward, so I was late to the next session.

### MOPping up Groovy - Venkat Subramaniam

This session was about meta-programming techniques in Groovy. My favorite part was the end where Venkat wrote a  executable DSL (domain specific language) in Groovy.

At this point I was pretty tired and none of the last set of panels really interested me, so I went home a little early.
