  		<content:encoded><![CDATA[ I have been making the transition from local Subversion and Mercurial repositories to [Git](http://git-scm.com/) and [GitHub](http://github.com/). GitHub is a brilliant piece of software as a service. It provides hosting for public and (for a fee) private repositories, adds a social media aspect in allowing you to follow fellow programmers work, and fork their repositories.

[ ![Pragmatic Version Control Using Git](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/519CeNsejdL._SL160_.jpg){: class="left" } ][1] I have been reading [Pragmatic Version Control Using Git][1] from the Pragmatic Programmers and have been impresses with the features and flexability of Git. I have tried Mercurial (it was okay) and Bazaar (hated it) and prefer Git, at least for now. The book is well written and fairly comprehensive of the things you might need to do with Git. There is also a great section on migrating from Subversion to Git.

Take a look at this video, a [Google talk by Linus Torvalds](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XpnKHJAok8) who is the author of Git (in addition to a little OS called Linux).  Linus is certainly opinionated about source code management software, but I do not think he is wrong most of the time. CVS is braindead and SVN gets a lot of less than ideal paradigms by being "CVS done right".

Anyway, my repository on GitHub can be found at [http://github.com/jhulten](http://github.com/jhulten) or by clicking the banner in the upper-right hand corner.
