> Ladies and gentlemen.. For your pleasure and edification, 
> allow me to present... The singing Tesla coils!
> 
> Yes, if you're clever, and you're willing to do a whole 
> lot of work, you can operate a Tesla coil so that the 
> sparking from the coil produces a particular pitch. 
> Even you're even more clever, you can vary the way that 
> the coil is run to produce different pitches, and arrange 
> it into a song. And if you're really remarkably clever, 
> you can set up two singing Tesla coils, and have them play a duet.
