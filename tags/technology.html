  		<content:encoded><![CDATA[ Thinking of technology and the World Cup, here is another opinionated segment.

I think the concept of absolute fairness is a black hole; a place where common sense is corrupted into political correctness.  We do not enforce an even playing field today in competitive sports.  For example, some kids have better health care or can afford a better trainer.

The question to my mind regards the impact of these 'smart shoes'.  Is there a significant improvement to a runners ability?  Does it reduce the chance of injury?  In my opinion the point of competition is for human beings to spur themselves to greater heights by comparing their achievements to others.  If this is the point and smart shoes measurably improve runner performance then there is a case for them to be banned, the case that this is a competition of humans, not humans and machines.

It is an interesting problem that we have not dealt with on an emotional and ethical level.  If we make judgment calls about what counts as unfair and what does not, then we risk losing the objectivity that fairness is built on.  If we make blanket statements about not allowing 'enhanced' humans compete, how do we deal with the kid that has the aural implant to allow him to hear or the chip in his brain to control epilepsy.  This kind of conflict of which science fiction blockbusters are made.

  		<content:encoded><![CDATA[ Digital data will not last forever unless we decide it is important.  To my mind this is a good thing.  In 200 years I really don't care if an anthropologist can look at my past bank statements.  The other side of the digital data explosion is that most of the data in the world now is CRAP.  I don't want to keep every spam message I have ever received. The important data I will chose to preserve.

I don't think this is particularly different from the written word.  Some people saved everything on paper, but many kept only what was important.  If something is important to me I will have it backed up and it will move forward in technology as I do.

  		<content:encoded><![CDATA[ When I look at questions like this I am reminded of the U.S. Supreme Court case, "Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc." also know and the "Betamax Case".  The decision of the court was that "making of individual copies of complete television shows for purposes of time-shifting does not constitute copyright infringement, but is fair use. The Court also ruled that the manufacturers of home video recording devices, such as Betamax or other VCRs (referred to as VTRs in the case), cannot be liable for infringement."  (Wikipedia)

It established a rule for technology that might be used to infringe copyright law, specifically: "The question is thus whether the Betamax is capable of commercially significant non-infringing uses..." (464 U.S. 417)

I think this is a excellent test for all technology.  If a product is capable of and primarily used for legal purposes then thats all I require.  I am not interested in buying anti-counterfeiting printers or scanners.  I am not going to counterfeit anything, but as the consumer I have to pay a higher price for something I don't want.

This puts government in a bad spot, but penalizing the many for the actions of the few is not acceptable.

  		<content:encoded><![CDATA[ This is a subject near and dear to my heart.  I think that open source is a fabulous thing, but by no means is the only way.  Some people say that having the source code open is an invitation to malicious code, data vandals and viruses.  Those people only need to look at the largest closed operating system in use today (Windows) to see that protecting your secrets is no way to guarantee security.  Just as an open source project has its code open for anyone to look at to find an exploit, it is also open that anyone can find that exploit and report it.  Thankfully there are still more honest people in the world than dishonest people, at least when you are talking about software.

For those that argue that programmers should be able to control and profit from their software you only need to look at Linux Torvalds to see that open source can be a career enhancer.  There is nothing preventing you from controlling or profiting from your code, open source is not mandatory.  You may have to write more of your code from scratch if the libraries you want to reuse that were written by others are licensed to prevent you from using them in a closed manner, but that is just that libraries coder controlling and profiting (in getting to see and use what you do with his/her code as opposed to money) from it.

It is proven that you can profit from an open model.  The SugarCRM customer relationship management software suite is an example of this.  Available for all, but they will host it or customize it or support it for you... for a fee.

Open source allows for far more innovation in a community by establishing defined rules for sharing your work and research.
