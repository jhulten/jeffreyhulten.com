  		<content:encoded><![CDATA[ It has been an interesting day. I talked my boss into letting me use my annual 'tuition' reimbursement to attend the Pacific Northwest Software Symposium put on my [No Fluff Just Stuff](http://nofluffjuststuff.com) in Redmond. The conference is different in that they cover hard core topics with no marketing spin. They do not have an expo hall, just breakout room with speakers that know their stuff.

I arrived at the Redmond Town Center Marriott at noon and checked in. Some of my coworkers, developers for whom this was training, were already there and we talked for a bit. The event started at 1300 with a short introduction session and then it was off to my first breakout session.

I spent the majority of the day in one room listening to one guy speak. [Jeff Brown](http://javajeff.blogspot.com/) is the VP of Professional Services at [G2One](http://g2one.com/) and a member of the core Groovy and Grails development teams. The first session was an introduction to [Groovy](http://groovy.codehaus.org/), a dynamic language that runs inside the Java Virtual Machine. I learned a few interesting things, but Groovy is similar in a lot of ways to Ruby so it wasn't too much of a stretch.

The second session with Jeff was about Grails. [Grails ](http://grails.org/)is a Java web framework built on top of Groovy. While the end result is a WAR file, you do not have all the nasty configuration files to wire together all the parts of your application. Grails includes Hibernate, Spring, log4j and other technologies but takes the heavy lifting away allowing the programmer to get to the core of the data domain and business logic.

Third was a session on advanced Grails where Jeff covered relationships, templates (what Rails calls 'partials'), custom tag libraries (worth the price of admission right there!), AJAX and more. This session was largely a live coding exercise and we walked through most anything that someone could come up with. While this was going on I created a basic Grails app myself and mucked around a bit.

Jeff was a really good speaker and was focused on getting the most content across that he could. I enjoyed his sessions and learned a far bit.

Then came dinner with great cheese bread and a terrific chocolate cake. I ate more of that than I should have.

After dinner we heard a keynote from one of the presenters, Jared Richardson. Jared, the co-author of a great book called [Ship It! A Practical Guide to Successful Software Projects](http://www.amazon.com/Practical-Guide-Successful-Software-Projects/dp/0974514047?SubscriptionId=1N9AHEAQ2F6SVD97BE02&tag=tragicallyl33-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0974514047), spoke about what he called &quot;Career 2.0&quot;. The focus of this keynote was that you need to treat your knowledge as you would any other investment. No one else is going to invest in you like you will. Diversify your investments so that you are more insulated from the whims of the job market. Acknowledge it will take effort, set goals and plan accordingly.

Also he talked at length about sharing the things that you know. He pushed hard on blogging; blog about every problem you solve, every mistake you make and correct, every thing you research. If you write lots you get better at writing and you make a name for yourself. I liked the concept of getting beyond resumes to name recognition.

Anyway, I really enjoyed today and am looking forward to tomorrow. More to come...

  		<content:encoded><![CDATA[ I got in a little late today, about 0845, which meant a fast breakfast and then off to the first session: Managing Project Integrity with David Bock of [CodeSherpas](http://codesherpas.com). This session was a whirlwind tour of tools to provide greater management and documentation of your code, from Maven to jDepend, Xradar to PMD. I didn't have power for my laptop and the battery was near dead so I don't have a lot of notes on the topic, but I do have a few ideas.

Next session was also with David Bock, Intermediate Maven. For those who do not know Maven it is a build management tools similar in some ways to Ant. I understand so much more than I did about Maven, especially the simple things like what the points in the lifecycle are and what order they run in. I am sure this is documented somewhere, but I just haven't found it.

We got into a great discussion about using private repositories to manage dependencies like Archiva or Artifactory. Between making sure that you always get the same version of, for instance, jUnit 3.8.1 and lowering your initial project setup time by caching those packages there doesn't seem to be much reason not to set one up. Just make sure you back it up!

Then we got into running Ant tasks inside of Maven, which is very cool. The ease of adding existing Ant targets to a lifecycle phase in Maven is slick. I will see about posting some examples of this later on.

Writing Maven plugins are pretty trivial. Maven gives you an archetype to build a base package and then it is just customization (maven-archetype-mojo). The process is pretty simple to build out, however it adds more complexity to your build process real fast.

Next is lunch followed by the expert panel discussion.

  		<content:encoded><![CDATA[ After lunch we had the 'expert panel discussion' where the speakers. One of the great quotes was "If you use Eclipse just because it is free we have a name for that... arranged marriage. You can get some things done, but there is no love."

I then went to "The Busy Developers Guide to Annotations" with [Ted Neward](http://tedneward.com) who was on the expert group that defined the annotations facility. After a thought experiment that covered how you would mark a class as Serializable in the old Java 1.1 days we moved to a live code example implementing an annotation on a person object.

The annotation example we developed was a validation annotation. The annotation sits in front of the thing that it modifies, just like the public keyword. An annotation adds no code to the method or class it modifies, just data that is accessible via reflection. Anything that you can put annotations on has the AnnotationElement interface, including classes and methods, in the reflection API. I learned that annotations have annotations including @Retention, which specifies how long the annotation should be available, either RUNTIME, SOURCE, or CLASS, and @Target which specifies where the annotation can be used, either methods, fields, classes, constructors and more.

Annotations should never be used to carry configuration information such as filenames or defaults. They cannot be changed at runtime. Annotations are compiled to an interface by the compiler.

A great observation from Ted is that while it is not acceptable to add a keyword to a twelve year old language, it is acceptable to use a existing keyword in a new and confusing context.

For my last session of the weekend I embraced my inner masochist and attended Venkat Subramaniam's talk on Functional Programming on the Java Virtual Machine. Functional programming is focused on well-behaved functions. Some of the benefits of a functional programming model is working with multi-core machines. When your functions can be passed to functions and functions do not have side effects, you can split those functions across multiple processors without data integrity issues.

An interesting point from Venkat is to initially ignore the syntax of a language and focus on the idiom. Every programming language hurts when you first learn it, but the compiler will catch the syntax errors.

His first example was from erlang, which is a pure functional language but not on the JVM.

{% highlight erlang %}
main(_) -> io:format("~p", [double([1,2,3,4,5])).
double(L) -> lists:map(fun(E) -> E * 2 end, L).
{% endhighlight %}

This takes the array 1 to 5 and runs the double function, then passes it to io:format to print to the console. The double function runs lists:map to run every element of the array and executes the anonymous function to double the value of each element.

Scala is a functional programming language that runs in the JVM. You can write Java like code in Scala, but you lose the concurrence protection.

{% highlight scala %}
val lst = List(1,2,3,4,5)
println(lst.map(_ * 2))
{% endhighlight %}

This is the same functionally (no pun intended) as the erlang code above.

Its official, my brain hurts.

  		<content:encoded><![CDATA[ NOTE: I delayed posting these entries to clean up my notes and add some useful links.

<i>GRUMPY NOTE: I lost a bunch of notes so this is based on my faulty memory and some slides.</i>

I got in a little late today after grabbing coffee and headed to [Michael Nygard's](http://michaelnygard.com/) presentation "Architect for Scale". I love the smell of capacity math in the morning.

### Amdahl's Law

$$ T_p = \sigma T_1 + ( 1 - \sigma ) \frac{T_1}{p} $$ 

#### Speedup Ratio

[pmath]S_p=T_1/1+sigma(p-1) [/pmath] 

### Universal Scalability Law

[pmath]C_p=p/1+sigma(p-1)+kappa p(p-1)[/pmath]
where
[pmath]sigma[/pmath] = contention
[pmath]kappa[/pmath] = coherency

Michael mentioned a book, [Guerrilla Capacity Planning](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/3540261389?ie=UTF8&tag=mylibrary01-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=3540261389) by Neil Gunther. It covers a lot of the mathematics of scalability and capacity planning.

There are only two ways to increase scalability: decrease contention or decrease conherency. Why is "improve performance" not on the list? Increasing performance increases capacity. Scalability is the measure of how added resources impact added capacity. Increasing performance can reduce your need for scalability, but does not benefit scalability. An interesting side note was that increasing performance generally means making the serial portion ([pmath]sigma[/pmath]) a larger portion of the total time. This means that as you spend more time on performance, you actually create a situation where you will reach maximum capacity with fewer processing resources.

### Brewer's Conjecture

You have heard the old quote "Faster, better, cheaper... Pick two"? Well when you are talking about systems architecture you can choose at most two of the following: 

- Consistency
- Availability
- Partition-Tolerance

Lets look at Michael's definitions: 

Consistency:
  There exists a total ordering on all operations, and all nodes in the system agree on that ordering at every point in time.
Availability:
  Every request received by a non-failing node must result in a response
Partition-Tolerance:
  The network may lose arbitrarily many messages from any subset of nodes to any other subset of nodes.

You want your system to be consistent and available? Partitioning is not allowed. How are you going to prevent partitioning? Do you expect servers, switches and network cards to never fail? This is unrealistic.

You want your system to be consistent and partitionable? Consistency can only be guaranteed if the service is unavailable during partitions. Otherwise you end up with 'split-brain'.

You want your system to be available and partitionable? We maintain availability during partitions by allowing different subsets to report different histories. This means that agreement or synchronization protocols are forbidden.

An important note: when you use and rely on ACID compliance of a relational database, you inherently select **Consistency**.

> "If you can't split it, you can't scale it." -- Randy Shoup, eBay

All partitioning strategies assume no cross-cluster dependencies on shared data. Shared writable data requires serialized access which raised [pmath]sigma[/pmath].

The database theory example for ACID compliance of a bank transaction is flawed as soon as User A and User B are with different banks. Instead of 'always consistent' we need to think about 'eventually consistent'.

[![Release It!](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41Nb-knuW-L._SL160_.jpg){: .left}](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0978739213?ie=UTF8&tag=tragicallyl33-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0978739213)

I decided to hang around for Michael's next talk, 'The 90-Minute Startup'. He talked about Amazon EC2. I lost all my notes on this talk, but seeing the cloud in action was pretty cool.

After lunch we had the expert panel discussion where Ken Sipe, Ted Neward, Matthew McCullough, Brian Sam-Bodden, and Michael Nygard talked about issues like the potential future of software development regulation, the potential impact of the IBM-Sun aquisition, and parallels between software engineering and the medical, legal, and construction.

After the panel I attended Ken Sipe's session on Java Memory, Performance, and Garbage Collection. I learned a bunch about the theory of garbage collection on the JVM. I picked up a few nice tips. To speed up your JVM startup time set your PermSpace and MaxPermSpace to the values based on what you see while your application is running. This way the JVM is not allocating space, finding is insufficent, reallocating over and over as you start up.

Some useful equations from the JVM memory management talk.

[pmath]E=S_n-(S_n/(R_s+2))*2[/pmath]

[pmath]S_s=(S_n-E)/2[/pmath]

where
[pmath]E[/pmath] = Size of Eden
[pmath]S_n[/pmath] = Size of New Space
[pmath]R_s[/pmath] = Survivor Ratio
[pmath]S_s[/pmath] = Size of Survivor Space

jps allows you to see processes either locally or remotely.

jstatd exposes the process information to jps over the network. A java security policy file is needed.

I stuck around for Ken&rsquo;s session as my last of the day, &ldquo;Debugging the Production JVM&rdquo;. After an example of VisualVM he moved into BTrace, a new feature in Java 1.6. It allows you to instrument a running JVM and get events when methods are called, or other activities take place.

All in all I had a great time and learned a whole bunch.

  		<content:encoded><![CDATA[ Its that time again! The No Fluff Just Stuff : Pacific Northwest Software Symposium has returned to the Redmond Marriot.

### Effective Java - Venkat Subramaniam

Unlike many talks, Venkat let us chose the topics. He put up a Jeopardy style board with categories like 'Syntax Sugar', 'Collections' and 'Objects' and let us pick. The content varied wildly, not in its quality (Venkat knows his stuff) but in just how deep into the rabbit hole it would lead you.

As an example, which is better?

{% highlight java %}
string1 + string2
new StringBuffer(string1).append(string2)
{% endhighlight %}

Normally you might think that the simple + would be less efficient, but thanks to syntactic sugar the opposite is true.

In Java 1.4 and above the simple + will use StringBuilder in the background. StringBuilder will preallocate space based on expectations and will not acquire and release locks like StringBuffer will.

There were a lot of code examples and we covered pitfalls and Java strangeness like the above.

### Common Antipatterns - Mark Richards

We started talking about common antipatterns in life as an example.

There are some common causes of anti-patterns:

- haste - aggressive deadlines and budgets drive lower standards of quality
- apathy - general lack of concern about finding the proper solution to a problem
- arrogance - refusal to accept solutions or practices generally known to be effective
- ignorance - failure (intentional or non-intentional) to seek a clear understanding of the problem space
- pride - refusal to leverage existing designs, code and frameworks; builds everything from scratch

**Object Orgy** - insufficiently encapsulated objects result in unrestricted access to their internals.

**Cargo Cult Programming** - using patters, methods and techniques without understanding why.

**Golden Hammer** - using the same tool, product or technique to solve every problem.

With the plethora of languages available on the JVM, we have all kinds of choice. For a comprehensive list of language options, see [http://www.is-research.de/info/vmlanguages/](http://www.is-research.de/info/vmlanguages/)

**Accidental Complexity** - introducing non-essential complexity into a solution.

> essential complexity: we have a hard problem
> 
> accidental complexity: we have made a problem hard
> 
> "developers are drawn to complexity like moths to a flame - often with the same result" - Neal Ford

**Lava Flow** - obsolete technologies and forgotten extensions leave hardened globules of dead code in its wake.

**The Blob** - an all encompassing class or component that knows too much and does too much.

Use a roles and responsibility model. Figure out in just a couple of sentences what the job of a given object is.

**Architecture by Implication** - systems lacking a clear architecture definition.

Don't rely too heavily on past experience; every problem is a little different.

### Groovy Testing - Scott Davis

There are some real benefits to using Groovy for testing. Groovy has the ability to get into the private guts of a Java object.

The concept of a 'private' field is a Java *language* construct, not a Java *platform* construct. This means you can get to private methods and fields.

### Keynote - Venkat Subramaniam

Venkat gave the keynote after dinner; an entertaining talk about the pointy-hairness in all of us, not just bosses.

  		<content:encoded><![CDATA[ ### Dim Sum Grails - Scott Davis

Grails is an open-source web framework written in Groovy. Grails is being used by major players like Wired.com, Taco Bell in Canada, and more. 

If you have ever created a domain (model) object in Grails and noticed the scaffolding lists fields in alphabetical order, there is a simple way past this. When you add your fields to the static constraints closure, Grails will output them in the order provided.

{% highlight groovy %}
class MyObject {
	String firstName
	String lastName
	Integer age
	
	static constraints = {
		lastName()
		firstName()
		age()
	}
}
{% endhighlight %}

Want to add Lucene to your application? Try this.

{% highlight text %}
> grails install-plugin searchable
{% endhighlight %}

All that is left to give yourself a search engine is add searchable=true to your domain classes.

{% highlight groovy %}
class MyObject {
	...
	static searchable = true	
	...
}
{% endhighlight %}

Once you have done that, start your application with grails run-app annd go to http://localhost:8080/app/searchable to see your search page.

### Design Patterns in Java and Groovy - Venkat Subramaniam

I have always had an interest in patterns since I attended Pattern Languages of Programming (PLoP) in 2006. Venkat refered to Java as a post-pattern language; the Gang of Four Design Patterns book came out just before Java, and so patterns are far easier to implement in Java than C++. Likewise we have power and flexibility in Groovy that we do not have in Java that enables pattern implementation.

I found myself in an interesting conversation with Barbee Davis and Ted Neward, so I was late to the next session.

### MOPping up Groovy - Venkat Subramaniam

This session was about meta-programming techniques in Groovy. My favorite part was the end where Venkat wrote a  executable DSL (domain specific language) in Groovy.

At this point I was pretty tired and none of the last set of panels really interested me, so I went home a little early.

  		<content:encoded><![CDATA[ My wife is, for the second year in a row, participating in NaNoWriMo, the National Novel Writing Month. In a effort to leech off her enthusiasm and not distract her by watching House reruns I will be doing MyProgWriMo, My Program Written in a Month.

The plan is to write stories that capture the work to be done in a month, hold one week sprints to execute stories, and release a functional (if not pretty) program at the end of November.

This is the first time I have tried a time-boxed activity like this, so we will see what happens. I will attempt to blog about the experience, but will focus on completing the stories first.

I decided to focus on Java development for this project. I have not done any serious Java programming in YEARS, so I needed a problem set that I understood well so I could focus on the HOW instead of on the WHAT.

SO, here it is. In one month I plan to write (with tests) a blogging platform. I know! Its so cliche... But I understand the issues and there is lots to learn.

Now, no one just writes Java code anymore (or so it seems) so I will be using some tools along the way. Hibernate (duh) will be used for persistence. Spring (double duh) will be used for IoC. I am thinking about Tapestry for presentation, but I have not gotten that far.

Stay tuned, boys and girls. It should be a wild ride.

Oh, and why didn't I choose Grails? I am pretty sure I can do this all in Grails. I want to know I can do it in Java as well.

  		<content:encoded><![CDATA[ This is going to be harder and easier than I thought.

So Tapestry supplies its own IoC container, so no Spring at this point. Also there is a nice Hibernate integration, so I am starting to mess with my entities and figure out the needed annotations.

Maven profiles seem to manage the different configuration aspects of my application such as properties for development versus a Hudson build.  So I can find it in the future, here is the profile snippet for development with a in memory database:

{% highlight xml %}
<profile>
    <id>development</id>
    <properties>
        <hibernate.dialect>org.hibernate.dialect.HSQLDialect</hibernate.dialect>
        <hibernate.connection.driver_class>org.hsqldb.jdbcDriver</hibernate.connection.driver_class>
        <hibernate.connection.url>jdbc:hsqldb:mem:autoblog</hibernate.connection.url>
        <hibernate.connection.username>sa</hibernate.connection.username>
        <hibernate.connection.password></hibernate.connection.password>
        <hibernate.connection.pool_size></hibernate.connection.pool_size>
        <hibernate.connection.autocommit>true</hibernate.connection.autocommit>
        <hibernate.cache.provider_class>org.hibernate.cache.HashtableCacheProvider
        </hibernate.cache.provider_class>
        <hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto>create-drop</hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto>
        <hibernate.show_sql>true</hibernate.show_sql>
    </properties>
</profile>
{% endhighlight %}

  		<content:encoded><![CDATA[ Many agile folks will talk about Iteration Zero: the stuff you have to do before you can do stuff. Mine is complete.

Yesterday (11/1) I:

- Created a basic project structure using a maven archetype
- Checked that structure into [source control](http://github.com/jhulten/autoblog)
- Setup a Hudson job to run [continuous integration](http://hudson.automatedlabs.com/hudson/job/autoblog/)

Today I have a light load (since it falls to me to feed the wife). I want to get my first page to render in Tapestry and continue research into the elements I will need like custom dispatching.

  		<content:encoded><![CDATA[ So I have been working on my project, but Tapestry has been kicking my butt. I have decided to step back and reset. I have useable DAOs and crappy DTOs and not much else.

So I am resetting. Grabbing the code that works, dropping Tapestry (the documentation on the IoC container and testing is not great) and going back to basics. Hibernate, Spring, Sitemesh...
