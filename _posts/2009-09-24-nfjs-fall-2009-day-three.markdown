Ah, the final day of No Fluff...

I spent the morning talking with Barbee Davis and Suzie Lewis Ship about topics ranging from science fiction to Agile development. As a result I missed Ken Sipe's Iteration 0 panel.

### 7 Habits of Highly Effective Developers - Ken Sipe

Ken's session is about applying the [The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0743269519?ie=UTF8&tag=tragicallyl33-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0743269519) by Stephen Covey to software developers. 

Covey's seven habits are:
- be proactive
- begin with the end in mind
- put first things first
- seek first to understand, then to be understood
- synergize
- sharpen the saw

Ken referred to a blog post "[Top 5 Attributes of Highly Effective Programmers](http://www.philosophicalgeek.com/2008/01/20/5-attributes-of-highly-effective-programmers/)". The attributes from that post are:

- Humility
- Love of Learning
- Detail Orientedness
- Adaptability
- Passion

He has his own list: 

- focused on a mission with a vision
- best researcher
- best debugger
- god complex when it comes to software development
  - not a lack of humility
  - just optimism to be able to do anything on the computer
- quality focused
- detailed oriented!

### Clojure - Howard Lewis Ship

I have never programmed in Lisp. Considering the other panels in the same time slot I figured I would do something about that and increase my knowledge with the Clojure session.

Clojure is a partial Lisp clone on the JVM with support for software transactional memory to keep your concurrent processes running smoothly.

### Hacking Your Brain for Fun and Profit - Nathaniel Schutta

This was the last panel I attended for the weekend, and a lot of fun. I enjoy thinking about and discussing learning techniques and such.

The only topic I will touch on here is the need for sleep. According to the [research](http://www.spokane.wsu.edu/ResearchOutreach/Sleep/documents/2003SLP-VanDongen-etal.pdf) Nate referenced, if you consistently get six hours of sleep when you need eight it is like missing two nights of sleep. Staying up one night results in a 30% drop in cognitive function...

So go take a nap. A 26 minute nap gives a 34% boost to performance.
