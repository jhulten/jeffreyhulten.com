Ah, the final day of No Fluff...

I spent the morning talking with Barbee Davis and Suzie Lewis Ship about topics ranging from science fiction to Agile development. As a result I missed Ken Sipe's Iteration 0 panel.

<h3>7 Habits of Highly Effective Developers - Ken Sipe</h3>

Ken's session is about applying the [The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0743269519?ie=UTF8&tag=tragicallyl33-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0743269519)<img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=tragicallyl33-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0743269519" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />
 by Stephen Covey to software developers. 

Covey's seven habits are:
<ul>
<li> be proactive</li>
<li> begin with the end in mind</li>
<li> put first things first</li>
<li> seek first to understand, then to be understood</li>
<li> synergize</li>
<li> sharpen the saw</li>
</ul>

Ken referred to a blog post "[Top 5 Attributes of Highly Effective Programmers](http://www.philosophicalgeek.com/2008/01/20/5-attributes-of-highly-effective-programmers/)". The attributes from that post are:

<ul>
<li> Humility</li>
<li> Love of Learning</li>
<li> Detail Orientedness</li>
<li> Adaptability</li>
<li> Passion</li>
</ul>

He has his own list: 

<ul>
<li> focused on a mission with a vision</li>
<li> best researcher</li>
<li> best debugger</li>
<li> god complex when it comes to software development</li>
	<ul>
	<li> not a lack of humility</li>
	<li> just optimism to be able to do anything on the computer</li>
	</ul>
<li> quality focused</li>
<li> detailed oriented!</li>
</ul>

<h3>Clojure - Howard Lewis Ship</h3>

I have never programmed in Lisp. Considering the other panels in the same time slot I figured I would do something about that and increase my knowledge with the Clojure session.

Clojure is a partial Lisp clone on the JVM with support for software transactional memory to keep your concurrent processes running smoothly.

<h3>Hacking Your Brain for Fun and Profit - Nathaniel Schutta</h3>

This was the last panel I attended for the weekend, and a lot of fun. I enjoy thinking about and discussing learning techniques and such.

The only topic I will touch on here is the need for sleep. According to the [research](http://www.spokane.wsu.edu/ResearchOutreach/Sleep/documents/2003SLP-VanDongen-etal.pdf) Nate referenced, if you consistently get six hours of sleep when you need eight it is like missing two nights of sleep. Staying up one night results in a 30% drop in cognitive function...

So go take a nap. A 26 minute nap gives a 34% boost to performance.
