[Seth Godin](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/) is a really smart guy. More importantly, he takes his ideas and does something with them.

I came across Seth in [an interview](http://www.43folders.com/2010/01/26/godin-linchpin) he did with [Merlin Mann](http://43folders.com). He talked a lot about fear and the [lizard brain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lizard_brain): the part of our brain that is only hungry, scared, selfish and horny. Its the part of our brains that ruled in high school.

It will also sabotage us if we let it.

Whenever we get close to completing something big or interesting or important to us, the lizard brain senses a threat. "What if we fail?" "Ridicule is painful!" "Better to go along in life quietly, then do something that might get us noticed."

The lizard brain tells us to quit when success is near. Seth mentioned in his interview that he listens to his lizard brain... and then does the opposite. If his lizard brain is quiet, he probably isn't doing anything important. If his lizard brain is screaming bloody murder, he knows he is on the right track.

I picked up a couple of Seth's books, including Tribes, The Dip, and his new book, Linchpin. As I come across more interesting tidbits I will share them.
