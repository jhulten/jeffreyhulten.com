You may have seen my [daily routine](/2009/02/24/daily-routine/) a while back. On top of having a daily routine, I find its important to have a weekly routine as well. My weekly routine is for things that I don't want to tackle every day (I am tired when I get home from work and don't want to spend my time paying bills) but need to get done regularly.

Therefore I have been building a weekly routine. The problem with a weekly routine is that it is harder to internalize than a daily routine.

So far I have managed a little bit of weekly routine at work on Mondays:
<ul>
	<li>review open tickets and determine priority for tasks this week</li>
	<li>review open tasks for items that haven't been touched in a couple of weeks
<ul>
	<li>consider removing those items entirely or moving to a someday file</li>
	<li>if they need to stay, consider their priority or if they can be delegated</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>review schedule and meetings this week
<ul>
	<li>block out large chunks of time for tasks</li>
	<li>leave the small gaps (for me, one hour or less) for other people to schedule meetings in</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
Here are the things I am trying to make a weekly routine:
<ul>
	<li>process postal mail (bills, etc.)</li>
	<li>do financial stuff (check accounts, verify payments, etc.)</li>
</ul>
