Lately I have been thinking a fair bit about my internal practices. Specifically what things I do on a daily, weekly or other regular basis. These things break out into beneficial routines and detrimental routines. Here is a snapshot of what I have captured.

### BENEFICIAL

<ul>
	<li>Review my todo list first thing when I get into work in the morning.</li>
	<li>Check my work email only a couple of times per day.</li>
	<li>Prioritize my work.</li>
	<li>Update my todo list with everything that I get done or need to do.</li>
	<li>Spend time on professional development.</li>
	<li>Get a few minutes of face time with my boss.</li>
</ul>

### DETRIMENTAL

<ul>
	<li>Getting on my computer before work in the morning.</li>
	<li>Check my personal email at work more than once a day.</li>
</ul>

Then there are things I need to be doing and aren't:

<ul>
	<li>Purge items from my todo list/replyto mailbox that I have not gotten too and is not important to my goals.</li>
	<li>Breaking tasks into managable next actions consistently and immeadiately.</li>
</ul>

What is your daily routine?
