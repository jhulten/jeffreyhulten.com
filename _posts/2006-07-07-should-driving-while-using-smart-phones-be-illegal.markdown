<p>There are valid concerns that the new technologies available are distracting drivers from driving, which is their primary task.  I have used my smart phone on the road, but I am careful to chose the time and place.  My opinion is that we need to enforce the results, not the cause.  As a country we seem to be nit-picking symptoms instead of the cause.  Instead of addressing long commute times and bad traffic conditions by building better roads or increasing public transit we want to ding people that are using their smart phones to find a route around or are talking on their phones to wile away the time.  </p>

<p>If the issue is distraction, why are we not talking about outlawing arguing children in the back seat of a car?  As a society, why are we not writing tickets left and right when people rubberneck at the scene of a traffic accident?  Technology requires people to learn the right and wrong way to use it.  We are just now seeing an establishment of manners in regards to use of cellular phones in public places.  You cannot legislate common sense and attempts to do so will just make more people into lawbreakers and lower their interest in playing by the rules.</p>
