I sit here writing this post with my hands crossed at my lap. I purchased a copy of MacSpeech Dictate. It will be interesting to see how well this program can transcribe my speech into text. It seems to be doing a pretty good job so far. I find it makes a few mistakes but the commands allow me to make corrections very quickly.

It's even smart enough with its commands to just understand what I mean. When I got to the end of a paragraph I was able to say "New Line" and it did the right thing. We will see whether this new tool helps me write more often now that I can get my fingers out of the space between my brain and the computer.
