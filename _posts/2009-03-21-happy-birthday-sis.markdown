Of late I have not put a lot of personal stuff on here, but my sister is worth it. We were seldom close growing up, grew closer in our college years, drifted apart a bit as I followed my ex to a non-family place, and have grow closer again over the past couple of years. She is a fabulous mother of four (five if you count my brother-in-law) and a great writer. She started blogging several months back and has brought laughter into my life and the lives of people around me with her comedic accountings of potty training twin boys, the process and perils of discovery, and more.

If you haven't read [my sisters blog](http://stillseekingsanity.blogspot.com), do so. If you have small children, have ever had small children, know someone who has small children, or have a pulse... read it. She writes of her adventures with a style and grace I didn't know she had.

I love you, sis!
