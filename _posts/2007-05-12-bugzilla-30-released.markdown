From the [bugzilla.org website](http://www.bugzilla.org/news/#release30):

> Today, the Bugzilla Project is extremely proud to 
> announce the release of Bugzilla 3.0, and just 
> like Terry said in 1998, "We like the new version 
> much better, and hope you will too."
>
> Here's just a sampling of the major new features in version 3.0:
>
> - Custom Fields
> - mod_perl support for greatly-improved performance
> - Per-Product Permissions
> - XML-RPC Interface
> - Create and Modify Bugs by Email
> - and much, much more...
>
> Bugzilla 3.0 also has a much-improved code base over 
> previous versions of Bugzilla. Improvements are still 
> happening, but long-time customizers and coders of 
> Bugzilla will notice significant improvements. And if 
> you haven't seen Bugzilla code since 2.16 or so,
> prepare to be (pleasantly) surprised!
