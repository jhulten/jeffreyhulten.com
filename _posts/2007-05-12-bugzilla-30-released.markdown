From the [bugzilla.org website](http://www.bugzilla.org/news/#release30):


<blockquote>
Today, the Bugzilla Project is extremely proud to announce the release of Bugzilla 3.0, and just like Terry said in 1998, "We like the new version much better, and hope you will too."

Here's just a sampling of the major new features in version 3.0:

<ul>
	<li>Custom Fields</li>
	<li>mod_perl support for greatly-improved performance</li>
	<li>Per-Product Permissions</li>
	<li>XML-RPC Interface</li>
	<li>Create and Modify Bugs by Email</li>
    	<li>and much, much more...</li>
</ul>

Bugzilla 3.0 also has a much-improved code base over previous versions of Bugzilla. Improvements are still happening, but long-time customizers and coders of Bugzilla will notice significant improvements. And if you haven't seen Bugzilla code since 2.16 or so, prepare to be (pleasantly) surprised!
