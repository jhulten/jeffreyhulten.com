<p>From [Good Math, Bad Math](http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2007/11/musical_goofiness_with_a_mathy.php).</p>
<blockquote><p>
 Ladies and gentlemen.. For your pleasure and edification, allow me to present... The singing Tesla coils!</p>
<p>Yes, if you're clever, and you're willing to do a whole lot of work, you can operate a Tesla coil so that the sparking from the coil produces a particular pitch. Even you're even more clever, you can vary the way that the coil is run to produce different pitches, and arrange it into a song. And if you're really remarkably clever, you can set up two singing Tesla coils, and have them play a duet.
