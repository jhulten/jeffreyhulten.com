I have been working on this 'little' project I call <a href="/projects/nodedb">NodeDB</a>, a document-oriented database written entirely in Python.  My work on it continues, but there may be others that are interested in helping.  If you are out there you can find the code at <a href="http://code.tragicallyleet.com/hg/nodedb">http://code.tragicallyleet.com/hg/nodedb</a>.  Patches can be submitted on a great little tool called <a href="http://www.review-board.org/">Review Board</a> at <a href="http://review.tragicallyleet.com">http://review.tragicallyleet.com</a>.
