title: What I Will Be Doing Without Taking Summer Vacation

So I am attending [Baker College Online](http://baker.edu), which I found on [allonlineschools.net](http://allonlineschools.net) (see [note](#collegepostnote)). I attended the University of Washington for many years and then ran out of money. Since the job market has gotten tougher I find it more difficult to get the interview.  I can almost always get a job I am qualified for if I can get in the door, but the thinly veiled "college dropout" on my resume was not helping.

As such I am persuing a Associates of Applied Science in Computer Programming.  I have worked out the details and I should be done, attending half time (eight credits per quarter), by Fall 2008.

This is what the next two years hold for me:

* Please note that I work for the company that produces allonlineschools.net.  I did, however, use their directory to research schools and find the one I wanted to go to.
