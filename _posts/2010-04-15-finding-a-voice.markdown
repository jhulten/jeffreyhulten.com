I have always had a tough time with the 'voice' of this blog. No more. I am just going to write and you, dear reader, will just have to cope! I am not going to let my lizard brain stop me from writing.

Here is a sample of the things I have in the queue:

* My Daily Routine: One Year Later
* Application Performance and Statistics
* Upgrading to Puppet 0.25

Stay tuned!
