So I have been working on my project, but Tapestry has been kicking my butt. I have decided to step back and reset. I have useable DAOs and crappy DTOs and not much else.

So I am resetting. Grabbing the code that works, dropping Tapestry (the documentation on the IoC container and testing is not great) and going back to basics. Hibernate, Spring, Sitemesh...
