title: NodeDB 0.1.0a2 Released
wordpress_url: http://tragicallyleet.com/?p=89
---
So I have this little project called NodeDB.  It is a Python powered document oriented database similar in some ways to CouchDB, Amazon Simple DB, or Google BigTables.  It is barely big enough to be considered a project at this point but I believe in releasing early and often.

Today I released the second alpha of version 0.1.0...  How is that for hedging my bets?  This release includes:
<ul>
	<li>Persistent filesystem storage of nodes</li>
	<li>Logging to standard error</li>
	<li>A running test suite</li>
</ul>
The next alpha version (slated to release in a couple of weeks) will add the beginnings of an indexing system and configuration files.

You can find my little project in its [source code repository](http://code.tragicallyleet.com/hg/nodedb) or on [PyPi](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/nodedb).
