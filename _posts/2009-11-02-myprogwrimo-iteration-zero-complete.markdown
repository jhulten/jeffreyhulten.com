Many agile folks will talk about Iteration Zero: the stuff you have to do before you can do stuff. Mine is complete.

Yesterday (11/1) I:

<ul>
	<li>Created a basic project structure using a maven archetype</li>
	<li>Checked that structure into [source control](http://github.com/jhulten/autoblog)</li>
	<li>Setup a Hudson job to run [continuous integration](http://hudson.automatedlabs.com/hudson/job/autoblog/)</li>
</ul>

Today I have a light load (since it falls to me to feed the wife). I want to get my first page to render in Tapestry and continue research into the elements I will need like custom dispatching.
