I recently moved my domains off of Rimuhosting and Dreamhost to [Linode](http://www.linode.com/).  They have by far the nicest dashboard I have seen for virtualized linux and great prices too.

Now to make great hosting better, they have started to roll their machines from UML (User Mode Linux) to the Xen virtualization platform.


> Xen has less overhead compared to UML. Xen Linodes have 4 
> processors. They support kernel modules. They support 32 
> and 64 bit kernels. We're running the latest Xen version 
> (3.2.1) which means we can support paravirt\_ops kernels 
> (pv\_ops), which means we can have kernels newer than 
> 2.6.18 (which a lot of our competitors force you to use). 
> In short, Linodes will be much, much faster under Xen.

I am thrilled with these guys, their service, and their commitment to improving their platform.
