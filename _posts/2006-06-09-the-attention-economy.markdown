<blockquote>
<p>"What information consumes is rather obvious: it consumes the attention of its recipients. Hence a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention, and a need to allocate that attention efficiently among the overabundance of information sources that might consume it."</p>
<p>- Herbert Simon, "Computers, Communications and the Public Interest"</p>
