My wife is, for the second year in a row, participating in NaNoWriMo, the National Novel Writing Month. In a effort to leech off her enthusiasm and not distract her by watching House reruns I will be doing MyProgWriMo, My Program Written in a Month.

The plan is to write stories that capture the work to be done in a month, hold one week sprints to execute stories, and release a functional (if not pretty) program at the end of November.

This is the first time I have tried a time-boxed activity like this, so we will see what happens. I will attempt to blog about the experience, but will focus on completing the stories first.

I decided to focus on Java development for this project. I have not done any serious Java programming in YEARS, so I needed a problem set that I understood well so I could focus on the HOW instead of on the WHAT.

SO, here it is. In one month I plan to write (with tests) a blogging platform. I know! Its so cliche... But I understand the issues and there is lots to learn.

Now, no one just writes Java code anymore (or so it seems) so I will be using some tools along the way. Hibernate (duh) will be used for persistence. Spring (double duh) will be used for IoC. I am thinking about Tapestry for presentation, but I have not gotten that far.

Stay tuned, boys and girls. It should be a wild ride.

Oh, and why didn't I choose Grails? I am pretty sure I can do this all in Grails. I want to know I can do it in Java as well.
