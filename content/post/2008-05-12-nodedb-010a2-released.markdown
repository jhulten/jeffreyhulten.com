So I have this little project called NodeDB. It is a Python powered document oriented database similar in some ways to CouchDB, Amazon Simple DB, or Google BigTables. It is barely big enough to be considered a project at this point but I believe in releasing early and often.

Today I released the second alpha of version 0.1.0... How is that for hedging my bets? This release includes:

- Persistent filesystem storage of nodes 
- Logging to standard error 
- A running test suite 

The next alpha version (slated to release in a couple of weeks) will add the beginnings of an indexing system and configuration files.

You can find my little project in its [source code repository](http://code.tragicallyleet.com/hg/nodedb) or on [PyPi](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/nodedb).
