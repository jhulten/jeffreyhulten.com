I saw a post about work/personal life balance on [http://positivesharing.com/](http://positivesharing.com/) where a comment was posted saying:

> Sorry I just don’t get this!! Work is work play is play. 
> I cannot stand it when people “decorate” their cube etc. 
> this is not kindergarden it is a place of work treat it 
> as such.
>
> Grow up! This constant moaning from people really annoys 
> me. If you are not happy at your Job leave. How about 
> this for a motivation to do your job, your SALARY!!
>
> Look at people in the third world and their plight and 
> get some perspective! Be glad you have a Job!

From there the question was asked...

> Why do we want to be happy at work? Why is it not enough 
> to go to work and get paid for it? Why do we want work 
> to be more engaging, playful and fun?

My response:

> To say that work is work and play is play is either overly 
> simplistic or not simplistic enough. I would rather simplify 
> this by saying “Life is life”. Sometimes your life is about 
> work and sometimes it is about play, but it is unrealistic 
> to completely separate your work and personal life. The only 
> way as a IT professional for me to keep my work life completely 
> out of my personal life is to not have a job and the only way 
> to keep my personal life out of my work life is to not have 
> friends, hobbies, hopes, dreams, etc.
